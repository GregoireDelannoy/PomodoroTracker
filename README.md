# PomodoroTracker
Python web application that serves a todo-list / timetracker / pomodoro

One day "let's discover Bottle and Python web dev"

## What works:
* Task managment as a tree
* Start/terminates them
* Time tracking
* Persistence to SQLite db (deployed version is memory-only)
* Docker deploy
* JavaScript is completely optional, used only for Notification and sound

## What lacks:
* Users! Login! Authentication! I expected Bottle to help me a bit more on this side... Not easy to do it all in a day.
* A stylesheet that doesn't make people's eye bleed
* UX seriously sucks
* More time tracking features (report, pause tasks, group them, delete, reorganize, ...)
